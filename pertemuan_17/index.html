    <h1>MOTIVATION</h1>
    <p><b>Connect to your Values</b></p>
    <ul>This is the ultimate secret. If you can connect the work you do to your values, even in small ways, you can change your game.
        One of my values is learning and growth.
        I find ways to grow my skills in any situation. For example, I don’t just “call back a customer.” I “win a raving fan.” I don’t just “do a task.” I “master my craft.” I don’t just “get something done.” I “learn something new.”</ul>
    <p><b>Find your way</b></p>
    <ul>Figure out a compelling purpose. Turn this into a one-liner.

        For example, when I fall off the horse, I remind myself I’m here to “make others great.” This gets me back on track, sharing the best of what I know.</ul>
        <p><b>Pair up</b></p>
        <ul>This is one of my favorite ways to make something fun. One person’s painful task, is another’s pleasure. Pair up with somebody who complements your skill or who can mentor you and get you over the humps.</ul>
